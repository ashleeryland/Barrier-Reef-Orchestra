<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The Barrier Reef Webite has a willing ambition to increase the number of people that attend their orchestra events.The website will publicise their orchestra expanding the concerts to new veiwers which will enlarge the attendence at the events.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of the new Barrier Reef Orchestra website will be evaluated not only by the amount of attendance at the orchestra but by the increase of user membership sign ups from the website. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p> The new and improved Barrier Reef Orchestra website will be designed in an attempt to gain the attention and active viewing of a younger audience, whilst still implementing an ease of access for the current older generation that access the site.</p>
<p>The website will be intentionally designed in a manner that suits a younger audience's needs. For example, brighter colour schemes using oceanic colours for the pages; simplifying information where possible as younger people will not want to read copious amounts, therefore; generating a feel of comfortability instead of intimidating the younger audience.</p>
